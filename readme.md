Todo:
=====

	*) Pacman like dots that give points or other kind of goals (cargo delivery (?))
	*) Better maps (image upload => translate grayscale to number map)
	*) Progress bar (show how much of the cars are trained)
	*) Change settings while running simulation
	*) Traffic lights
	*) Find better default values (especially when collision is activated)
	*) Write how it works
	*) Remove/add cars during simulation
	*) Remove/add player car during simulation
